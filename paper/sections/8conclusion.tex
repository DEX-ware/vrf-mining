\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose VRF-based mining, that can make pooled mining in Proof-of-work-based consensus impossible.
VRF-based mining is simple and intuitive: miners produce hashes of blocks using VRFs rather than hash functions, so a pool operator should reveal his private key to outsource the mining process to other miners.
In addition, we informally show the non-outsourceability of VRF-based mining and describe how to instantiate VRFs for implementing VRF-based mining.
Moreover, we discuss potential problems of having no mining pools and how to address them.

While formally defining non-outsourceable cryptocurrency mining and VRF-based mining takes more research effort, we would leave it to future work.
Also, as aforementioned, ruling out pooled mining can achieve better decentralisation but may harm the incentive of mining.
How to achieve decentralisation while preserving the incentive of mining is still an open challenge.
