\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose VRF-based mining, that can make pooled mining in Proof-of-work-based consensus impossible.
VRF-based mining is simple and intuitive: miners produce hashes of blocks using VRFs rather than hash functions, so that a pool operator should reveal his secret key to outsource the mining process to other miners.
We informally prove that VRF-based mining achieves the strongest notion of \emph{non-outsourceability}.
In addition, we discuss considerations of instantiating VRF-based mining.
Moreover, we experimentally proves that VRF-based mining is simple to implement and introduces negligible overhead.
