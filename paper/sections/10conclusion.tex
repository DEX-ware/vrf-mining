\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose VRF-based mining, that can make pooled mining in Proof-of-work-based consensus impossible.
VRF-based mining is simple and intuitive: Miners produce hashes of blocks using VRFs rather than hash functions, so a pool operator should reveal his private key to outsource the mining process to other miners.

As aforementioned, ruling out pooled mining can achieve better decentralisation but may harm the incentive of mining.
How to achieve decentralisation while preserving the incentive of mining is still an open challenge.
