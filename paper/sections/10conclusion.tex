\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose VRF-based mining, that can make pooled mining in Proof-of-work-based consensus impossible.
VRF-based mining is simple and intuitive: miners produce digests of blocks using VRFs rather than hash functions, so that a pool operator should reveal its secret key to outsource the mining process to other miners.
We show that VRF-based mining achieves strong \emph{non-outsourceability} guarantee.
In addition, we discuss considerations of instantiating VRF-based mining.
Moreover, we experimentally proves that VRF-based mining is simple to implement and introduces negligible overhead.

Adding \emph{stealing-unlinkability} to VRF-based mining remains as an open problem.
The key -- as discussed by Miller et al.~\cite{miller2015nonoutsourceable} -- is to exclude everything that the pool operator can exploit to track miners from mining.
A possible construction can be excluding Merkle root from mining and replacing VRF with \emph{Anonymous VRF}~\cite{ganesh2019proof} -- a VRF variant where VRF outputs cannot be linked to any secret key.
We consider concrete construction as future work.
