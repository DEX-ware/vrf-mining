\section{Supporting different mining algorithms}

\HY{I am not sure about this section.}

Existing mining algorithms can be easily integrated into VRF.
Currently, all existing mining algorithms take an input and then perform hash on it. 
As shown in appendix~\ref{vrf_standardised_construction}, our construction accepts an arbitrary-length input $\alpha$, depending on the blockchain data structure.
To support different mining algorithms, we can simply use the hash function in the targeted mining algorithm as our $H_{1}$.
Thus, we construct a $\mathsf{VRFHash}$ supporting different mining algorithms.
