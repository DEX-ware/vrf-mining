\section{Supporting different mining algorithms}

Existing mining algorithms can be easily integrated into VRF.
Currently, all existing mining algorithms take an input and then perform hash on it. 
As shown in appendix~\ref{vrf_standardised_construction}, our construction accepts arbitrary-length inputs, depending on the blockchain data structure.

Therefore, our constrution can support different mining algorithms.
