\section{Security and Non-outsourcability}

\RH{Let's extend this section to security and nonoutsourcability justification, which extends Miller's paper.
In particular, 
1. We list/reformalise desired properties that can render pooled mining impossible. This should inlcude: Correctness, Feasibility, Parallelisability, Imcompressibility, Nonoutsourcability (we should reformalise this one), Non-transferability, .
2. In addition, we should justify 1. support of different hash algos, 2. hash should be slower than EC.
Runchao will do this part.}

% need private key
As shown in appendix~\ref{vrf_standardised_construction}, both $\mathsf{VRFHash}$ and $\mathsf{VRFProve}$ take secret key $sk$ as input.
That is to say, if a pool operator would like to provide pooled mining service and let miners participate, he will need to provide miners with his secret key.

% none would like to provide private key
However, none rational pool operator will tend to give out his secret key, as revealing his secret key give others the opportunity to redeem his balance or forge his identity.

Therefore, following our construction, we eliminate the intentionality of pooled mining and can reduce the centralisation of mining power significantly.
