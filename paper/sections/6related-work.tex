% 1. The first step can still be outsourced. it cannot prevent centralisation, but reduce centralisation
% 2. SIG is usually done by ECDSA or EdDSA, where these two signatures contain a changable parameter k, which can be another traversal space. VRF does not give this opportunity. (select a cryptographically secure random integer k from [1, n-2])

% BetterHash
BetterHash~\cite{draft-bip-BetterHash} is one of the solutions to the mining power centralisation.
However, BetterHash suffers from criticism.
BetterHash doesn't really solve the centralised pooled mining, \TODO{because}.
% create block_templeate: select txs, build coinbase tx
BetterHash requires miner technical knowledge to create a block templeate, manage and run a full node, etc..
