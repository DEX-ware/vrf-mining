% TODO: read the comments
Eyal et al.~\cite{2P-PoW} propose \textit{Two Phase Proof of Work} (\textit{2P-PoW}) for smooth transition to large pool disincentivisation.
This solution is backward-compatible because it preserves blockchain data and retains mining hardware. 
However, \textit{2P-PoW} still suffers from several problems:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\circ$}
    \item it does not deter mining pools but merely reduce centralisation, since phase 1 is outsourcable;
    \item $\mathsf{SIG}$ in phase 2 is usually achieved by \textit{ECDSA} or \textit{EdDSA}, containing a changable cryptography parameter, which leads to another traversal space (such a problem does exist in VRF because the parameter is determined once a VRF is chosen);
    \item it still requires a hard fork.
\end{itemize}

% BetterHash
\paragraph{BetterHash}
BetterHash~\cite{draft-bip-BetterHash} is one of the solutions to the mining power centralisation.
However, BetterHash suffers from criticism.
BetterHash doesn't really solve the centralised pooled mining, \TODO{because}.
% create block_templeate: select txs, build coinbase tx
BetterHash requires miner technical knowledge to create a block templeate, manage and run a full node, etc..
