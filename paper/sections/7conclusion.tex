\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we reminds people the centralised hash power distribution in Bitcoin and the subsequences.
We then construct VRF-based mining to resolve the centralised pooled mining criticism,
with a following discussion on balancing sybil-resistance and incentivisation.
We also analyse the candidate solutions to mining power centralisation, and point out that unfortunately none of them prevent pooled mining.
