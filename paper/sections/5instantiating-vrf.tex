\section{Instantiating VRF}


% 3. How to instantiate VRF. support of different hash algos (hash should be slower than EC).

\RH{this part we should discuss all 3 hash functions. Here we only talk about H2 (for producing hash). This might be tricky, so leave it the last one to do}

Existing mining algorithms can be easily integrated into VRF.

Currently, all existing mining algorithms take an input and then perform hash on it. Different algorithms vary with input length (depending on the blockchain data structure), and the hash function.
As shown in appendix~\ref{vrf_standardised_construction}, our construction accepts an arbitrary-length input $\alpha$.
We then simply use the hash function in the targeted mining algorithm as our $H_{1}$.
Thus, our scheme can add supports for different mining algorithms.
