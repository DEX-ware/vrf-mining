\section{Instantiating VRF}
\label{sec:instantiation}

In order to implement VRF-based mining, one needs to first instantiate the VRF.
VRF in Algorithm~\ref{algo:standard-ecvrf} has four configurable components, including the elliptic curve and three hash functions.
Three hash functions are:
$H_{1}(\cdot)$ mapping an arbitrary-length string into an elliptic curve element,
$H_{2}(\cdot)$ mapping an elliptic curve element into a fixed-length string, and
$H_{3}(\cdot)$ mapping an arbitrary-length string into a fixed-length string.
We discuss considerations on choosing these four components for VRF-based mining.





\subsection{Elliptic curve}
As neither blockchains and VRF limits the choice of elliptic curves, any elliptic curve can be adapted.
For example, among prominent elliptic curves, Ed25519~\cite{bernstein2012high} can be a promising choice.
First, Ed25519 works on a prime field with the prime number $2^{255} - 19$, which provides sufficient enumeration space for VRF.
Second, Ed25519 supports EdDSA, a fast and secure digital signature algorithm.
Last, Ed25519 is compatible with existing blockchains, as numerous blockchains and projects using VRF adapt Ed25519 as their underlying elliptic curve~\cite{ethereum}\cite{tendermint}\cite{monero}.



\subsection{Hashing a string to an elliptic curve point $H_{1}(\cdot)$}
The first hash function $H_{1}(\cdot)$ hashes a string to an elliptic curve point.
A standardisation document~\cite{scott2019hashing} specifies several hash-to-curve functions~\cite{icart2009hash}~\cite{ulas2007rational}~\cite{brier2010efficient}~\cite{bernstein2013elligator} that fit into different elliptic curves and satisfy our requirements.
Within these functions, Elligator2~\cite{bernstein2013elligator} is the recommended one for Ed25519.




\subsection{Hashing an elliptic curve point to a string $H_{2}(\cdot)$}
The second hash function $H_{2}(\cdot)$ hashes an elliptic curve point to a fixed-length string.
It can be divided to two steps: 1) encoding an elliptic curve point to a string, and 2) hashing the string using a normal hash function.
The encoding step can be bidirectional and unencrypted, so can be done simply by converting a big integer to a string.
The hashing step should be cryptographically secure, so can adapt any existing cryptographically secure hash functions.


\subsection{Normal hash function $H_{3}(\cdot)$}
The third hash function $H_{3}(\cdot)$ hashes an arbitrary string to a fixed-length string.
It is only used in $\mathsf{VRFProve}(\cdot)$ and $\mathsf{VRFVerify}(\cdot)$ i.e., producing and verifying proofs of VRF outputs.
The overhead of proving and verification should be minimised, so fast and cryptographically secure hash functions such as Keccak~\cite{bertoni2013keccak} and BLAKE~\cite{aumasson2008sha} are suitable for $H_{3}(\cdot)$.


\subsection{Memory-hard mining}
Some PoW-based blockchains --- such as Ethereum~\cite{wood2014ethereum} and Monero~\cite{monero} --- employ memory-hard hash functions in order to minimise advantage of specialised mining hardware and achieve better decentralisation.
Different from normal hash functions, the performance of computing memory-hard hash functions is bounded by memory access rather than arithmetic operations in processors.
As memory access is much harder to optimise compared to arithmetic operations in processors, high-end hardware cannot outperform low-end hardware greatly in terms of memory-hard functions.

% VRFHash should memory-hard
To make VRF-based mining memory-hard, $\mathsf{VRFHash}(\cdot)$ should be memory-hard.
% vrfhash steps
$\mathsf{VRFHash}(\cdot)$ of the standardised VRF consists of one $H_{1}(\cdot)$ hashing, one scalar-point multiplication and one $H_{2}(\cdot)$ hashing.
By making $H_{1}(\cdot)$ or $H_{2}(\cdot)$ memory-hard, VRF-based mining will be memory-hard.
This can be achieved by embedding a memory-hard hash function such as Ethash~\cite{wiki2017ethash} and CryptoNight~\cite{seigenneocortex} in $H_1(\cdot)$ or $H_2(\cdot)$.
