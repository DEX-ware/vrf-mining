\subsection{Why miners join mining}

PoW-style blockchains incentivise miners to maintain the transaction history.

Block subsidy and transaction fees are to encourage miners to keep recording new transaction.
This help provide the blockchain with liveness: new blocks and valid transactions with appropriate feed will continue to be added to the ledger.

The incentive also motivate the miners to stay honest and is to achieve incentive compatibility~\cite{}.
Because the agreed chain has the corresponding PoW effort accumulated, to alter the history and double-spend his money, a miner need to control a considerable amount of hash power to redo the PoW of the block, in which his first transaction was included, and all the following blocks since it.
The probability of his success diminishes exponentially to the number of blocks to be redone, while at the same time there are new blocks kept being added to the original chain. 
A miner owning such a computing power may choose between using it to double spend his money, or using it to mine new blocks and get rewarded. 

To keep the blockchain system running expectedly, the reward needs to be profitable.
Therefore, miners are incentivised to join mining.

\subsection{Why miners join mining pools}

\RH{1. pooled mining is possible, 2. pooled mining rewards more stable, ...}

% low computing power -> less likely to mine -> unstalbe in a period -> more centralised

\subsection{Balancing the sybil resistance and incentive}

\RH{There is a trade-off between sybil resistance and the incentive for miners to join the mining... Need some balance...}

% btc resists by pricing
% our construction: resistant but not stable
% less incentivised
% lower power

sybil attack is 
reputation system
forging identity

easier to find solution
easier to generate identity
less resistant

in bitcoin, leader, id, PoW, longest chain
The longest chain serves proof of transaction history caming from the largest pool of computing power.
As long as the majority of the computing power remain honest.
In bitcoin, the nodes are incentivised to maintain the history
the profit is low for misbehaving

% eclipse
easy to gen id -> full connection -> overwrite history


our construction
balance
cheaper to 51 and less sybil-resistant


As aforementioned, unstable payouts will be risky.

Such a problem is known as Quadratic Voting~\cite{lalley2018quadratic}.
