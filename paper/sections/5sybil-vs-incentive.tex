\section{Sybil-resistance v.s. incentive compatibility}

\subsection{Why consensus requires mining}

\RH{sybil attack}

% sybil vs eclipse

\subsection{Why miners join mining}

% bitcoin whitepaper

% incentive paper

\RH{mining can have rewards -> incentive}

\subsection{Why miners join mining pools}

\RH{1. pooled mining is possible, 2. pooled mining rewards more stable, ...}

% low computing power -> less likely to mine -> unstalbe in a period -> more centralised

\subsection{Balancing the sybil resistance and incentive}

\RH{There is a trade-off between sybil resistance and the incentive for miners to join the mining... Need some balance...}

% btc resists by pricing
% our construction: resistant but not stable
% less incentivised
% lower power

sybil attack is 
reputation system
forging identity

easier to find solution
easier to generate identity
less resistant

in bitcoin, leader, id, PoW, longest

easy to gen id -> full connection -> overwrite history


our construction
balance
cheaper to 51 and less sybil-resistant


We leave for future work quantitative study on a more formal model of the \TODO{.....}.
