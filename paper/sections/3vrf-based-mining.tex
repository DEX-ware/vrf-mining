\section{VRF-based mining}

\subsection{Our construction}

We replace hash function in the mining by VRF, and construct VRF-based mining.

The desired properties of a well-designed hash function includes uniformity, deterministic, unpredictability and verifiability.

\TODO{prove uniformity \& deterministic}

As shown in appendix~\ref{}, ...
Therefore, VRF fits in here.

To rule out pooled mining, we combine VRF with digital signature scheme.
As the digital signature scheme use in cryptocurrency are based on Elliptic curve, we construct Elliptic curve based VRF for our VRF-based mining.
The standardised construction is put in the appendix~\ref{}.

\subsection{Why mining pools cannot work here}

% need private key

% no client would like to provide private key

% balance be spent
