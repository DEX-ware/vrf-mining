Instead of using a hash function, VRF-based mining uses a VRF to produce outputs that satisfy the difficulty requirement.
VRF takes both an input and a secret key to produce an output.
The owner of this secret key can produce a proof proving the ownership of his output.
Thus, to outsource the mining process, the pool operator has to reveal his secret key to miners.
However, with the secret key, any miner in the mining pool can steal all mining rewards.

Cryptocurrency mining consists of two components, namely mining blocks and verifying blocks.
We call the process of mining a block $\mathsf{Work}$, and the process of verifying a block $\mathsf{Verify}$.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:work} and \ref{algo:verify} describe $\mathsf{Work}$ and $\mathsf{Verify}$ of VRF-based mining, respectively.

\textbf{Work.}
Miners run $\mathsf{Work}$ to mine new blocks.
More specifically, a miner - with his private key $sk$ the block template (a complete block without nonce) $t$ - keeps searching for a nonce $n$ that can make the VRF output $out$ of the block $blk$ to meet the blockchain difficulty $T$.
Once finding a valid $n$, the miner produces the proof $\pi$ and $out$, and appends $blk$ (with $n$), $out$ and $\pi$ to the blockchain.

\textbf{Verify.}
Upon incoming blocks, miners run $\mathsf{Verify}$ to verify their validity.
While other verifications are the same as in hash-based mining, $\mathsf{Verify}$ in VRF-based mining should additionally run $\mathsf{VRFVerify}(\cdot)$ to verify 1) whether $out$ is produced by the owner of $sk$, and 2) whether $out$ is a valid output of $\mathsf{VRFHash}(sk, blk)$.

\textbf{Block structure.}
In hash-based mining, a miner should sign the block he mines, and the blockchain should store both the block and the associated signature.
In VRF-based mining, the blockchain can omit the signature, but should attach $out$ and $\pi$ for each block.
Other miners without knowing $sk$ cannot produce $out$, but can use $\pi$ to verify $out$ is generated by someone knowing $sk$.
The proof $\pi$ proves that, 1) the block is produced by someone knowing $sk$, and 2) the digest of this block is $out$.
