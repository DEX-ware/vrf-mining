\section{VRF-based mining}

\subsection{Our construction}

As the digital signature scheme use in cryptocurrency are based on Elliptic curve, we construct Elliptic curve based VRF for our VRF-based mining.
The standardised construction is put in the appendix~\ref{}.

% word for construction (for example, follow mpc-sok)

\RH{replace hash by VRF...}

As shown in appendix~\ref{}, 


% what we need:
% unpredictability
% verifiability
% VRF fits in

\subsection{Why mining pools cannot work here}

% need private key

% no client would like to provide private key

% balance be spent
