\section{Introduction}

\TODO{we need to justify for PoS. does PoS also have mining?}

\RH{describe Bitcoin and PoW}

\RH{describe mining and mining pool}

Payouts will be less frequent for a solo miner controlling low computing power.
Miner need to pay for electricity periodically and get the investment back.
Inconsistent payouts will be risky for miners.
To reduce the risk, miners join mining pool
no need to run full node and deal with block creation, block propogation
can focus on running mining rigs, for example, ASICs.

Pool operator, run full node, distribute task
produce a block if find solution meeting target difficulty.

However, mining in Bitcoin network suffers from centralisation.

% show centralisation

\RH{describe mining pool breaks the decentralisation}

Suppose the two scenarios listed below:

% "Machine gun pool"?

% Big whale
% the cost is not huge, 

malicious attack
double spend, 51\%, with selfish mining, only requires ... 33?25?
a group of pool operators can collude.

DNS, steal miners power


Even not for 51, 
pool operators may refuse protocol upgrade. \TODO{for what? why bad?}


In this work, we put forward a novel idea of combining VRF and mining in PoW to make pooled mining impossible, and to conquer the centralisation of mining power.
We call our constrcution \textbf{VRF-based mining}.
