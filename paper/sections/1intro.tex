\section{Introduction}

\TODO{we need to justify for PoS. does PoS also have mining?}

\RH{describe Bitcoin and PoW}

\RH{describe mining and mining pool}

% show centralisation

\RH{describe mining pool breaks the decentralisation}

Suppose the three scenarios listed below:

% Big whale

% so-called 

% terminology for "Machine gun pool"?

% the cost is not huge


\RH{in this paper, we introduce a novel mining mechanism that makes pooled mining impossible...}

In this work, we put forward a novel idea of combining VRF and mining in PoW to make pooled mining impossible, and to conquer the centralisation of mining power.
