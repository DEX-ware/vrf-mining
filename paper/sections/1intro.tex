\section{Introduction}

\TODO{we need to justify for PoS. does PoS also have mining?}

\RH{describe Bitcoin and PoW}

\RH{describe mining and mining pool}

To ... 
miners join mining pool
no need to run full node 
can only run mining rigs, for example, ASICs.

Pool operator, run full node, distribute task
produce a block if found solution meeting target difficulty.

However, mining in Bitcoin network suffers from centralisation.

% show centralisation

\RH{describe mining pool breaks the decentralisation}

Suppose the two scenarios listed below:

% "Machine gun pool"?

% Big whale
% the cost is not huge, 

malicious attack
double spend, 51\%, with selfish mining, only requires ... 33?25?

DNS, steal miners power


Even not for 51, 
pool operators may refuse protocol upgrade. \TODO{for what? why bad?}


In this work, we put forward a novel idea of combining VRF and mining in PoW to make pooled mining impossible, and to conquer the centralisation of mining power.
We call our constrcution \textbf{VRF-based mining}.
