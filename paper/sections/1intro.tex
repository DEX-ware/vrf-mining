\section{Introduction}

\TODO{we need to justify for PoS. does PoS also have mining?}

\RH{describe Bitcoin and PoW}

\RH{describe mining and mining pool}

To ... 
miners join mining pool
no need to run full node 
can only run mining rigs, for example, ASICs.

Pool operator, run full node, distribute task

However, mining in Bitcoin network suffers from centralisation.

% show centralisation

\RH{describe mining pool breaks the decentralisation}

Suppose the two scenarios listed below:

% "Machine gun pool"?

% Big whale
% the cost is not huge, 

malicious attack
double spend, 51\%, with selfish mining, only requires ... 33?25?

DNS, steal miners power


Even not for 51, 
pool operators may refuse protocol upgrade. \TODO{for what? why bad?}


In this work, we put forward a novel idea of combining VRF and mining in PoW to make pooled mining impossible, and to conquer the centralisation of mining power.
We call our constrcution \textbf{VRF-based mining}.
