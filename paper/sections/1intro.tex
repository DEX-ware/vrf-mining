\TODO{we need to justify for PoS. does PoS also have mining?}

\RH{describe Bitcoin and PoW}

\RH{describe mining and mining pool}

However, mining in Bitcoin network suffers from....

% show centralisation

\RH{describe mining pool breaks the decentralisation}

% pool operators

Suppose the three scenarios listed below:

% Big whale

% so-called 

% terminology for "Machine gun pool"?

% the cost is not huge


In this work, we put forward a novel idea of combining VRF and mining in PoW to make pooled mining impossible, and to conquer the centralisation of mining power.
We call our constrcution \textbf{VRF-based mining}.
