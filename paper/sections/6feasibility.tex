\section{Feasibility evaluation}
\label{sec:feasibility}

In this section, we evaluate the feasibility of implementing VRF-based mining.
Our evaluation is twofold.
First, we compare the performance of VRFs with three other hash functions used for cryptocurrency mining, namely SHA256D used in Bitcoin, Scrypt used in Litecoin and CryptoNight used in Monero.
The comparison shows that VRF can be hundred times faster than Ethereum and CryptoNight, so can be highly efficient.
Second, we measure the runtime of each step ($H_1$, point multiplication and $H_2$) of $\mathsf{VRFHash}$.
The profiling shows that the point multiplication takes approximately 88\% of $\mathsf{VRFHash}$'s runtime, which is the performance hotspot.

\subsection{Experimental setting}

We implement the standardised EC-VRF in Algorithm~\ref{algo:standard-ecvrf} using Go programming language.
In particular, we use Ed25519~\cite{bernstein2012high} as the underlying elliptic curve, Elligator~\cite{bernstein2013elligator} as $H_1(\cdot)$, SHA-3 as the hash function.
Ed25519, SHA-3 and the encoding of points on Ed25519 are supported by Go's standard library.
We do not apply any optimisations on the EC-VRF implementation.
We use open-source implementations for SHA256D~\ref{github.com/seehuhn/sha256d}, Scrypt~\ref{github.com/elithrar/simple-scrypt}, and CryptoNight~\ref{ekyu.moe/cryptonight}.

All experiments run on a MacBook Pro with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 Processor, a 16 GB DDR4 RAM and 256 SSD storage disk.
For each group of experiment, we run an algorithm for ten times, then take the average data as the experimental results.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:runtime-comparison} shows the runtime of VRF and other algorithms.
First, SHA256D is much faster than other algorithms.
This is because SHA256D is simply executing SHA256 hashing twice, which is quite fast.
Second, Generating proofs is slightly slower than hashing for VRF.
This is because $\mathsf{VRFProve}$ includes $\mathsf{VRFHash}$ and additionally generates a proof for the hash.
Last, both $\mathsf{VRFHash}$ and $\mathsf{VRFProve}$ are hundred times faster than Scrypt and CryptoNight.
This means that VRF is easy to implement and introduces little overhead, so suitable for cryptocurrency mining.
