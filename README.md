# VRF-based mining

This idea is co-developed by Runchao Han (runchao.han@monash.edu) and Haoyu Lin (chris.haoyul@gmail.com). Please find [the writeup](https://github.com/SebastianElvis/vrf-mining/blob/master/paper/main.pdf) for more detail.

We introduce VRF-based mining, a surprisingly simple and effective way of making pooled mining impossible. Instead of using hash functions, we use Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) for proof-of-work-based consensus. As VRF binds the authorship with hashes, a pool operator should reveal his private key to outsource the mining process to miners, and miners can easily steal cryptocurrency in the pool operatorâ€™s wallet anonymously.
